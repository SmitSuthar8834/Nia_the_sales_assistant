# Task 2: Lead Information Extraction Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Task Completed Successfully

**Task**: Implement lead information extraction from text

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## üöÄ What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Lead Information Extraction Function
- **Location**: `ai_service/services.py` - `GeminiAIService.extract_lead_info()`
- **Features**:
  - Advanced prompt engineering for better extraction accuracy
  - Context-aware extraction with optional context parameter
  - Structured data extraction for comprehensive lead information
  - Confidence scoring and data completeness calculation
  - Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 2. Structured Data Extraction
- **Enhanced Data Structure**:
  ```python
  {
      "company_name": "Company name",
      "contact_details": {
          "name": "Contact person name",
          "email": "Email address",
          "phone": "Phone number",
          "title": "Job title",
          "department": "Department"
      },
      "pain_points": ["List of business challenges"],
      "requirements": ["List of specific needs"],
      "budget_info": "Budget information",
      "timeline": "Project timeline",
      "decision_makers": ["List of decision makers"],
      "industry": "Business sector",
      "company_size": "Company size info",
      "urgency_level": "high|medium|low",
      "current_solution": "Existing solutions",
      "competitors_mentioned": ["Competitor names"],
      "extraction_metadata": {
          "confidence_score": 85.0,
          "data_completeness": 70.0,
          "extraction_method": "gemini_ai_enhanced"
      }
  }
  ```

### 3. Entity Recognition and Data Validation
- **DataValidator Class**: `ai_service/services.py`
  - Email format validation using regex patterns
  - Phone number format validation
  - Company name cleaning and validation
  - Comprehensive lead data validation with error reporting
  - Data deduplication and cleaning

- **Entity Extraction**: `GeminiAIService.extract_entities()`
  - Pattern-based extraction for emails, phones, monetary amounts
  - AI-powered extraction for complex entities (companies, people, technologies)
  - Combined approach for maximum accuracy

### 4. Enhanced API Endpoints
- **Main Analysis Endpoint**: `POST /ai_service/analyze/`
  - Full conversation analysis with lead extraction
  - Optional entity extraction and recommendations
  - Enhanced response formatting with validation results

- **Dedicated Lead Extraction**: `POST /ai_service/extract-lead/`
  - Focused lead information extraction only
  - Faster processing for simple extraction needs

- **Entity Extraction**: `POST /ai_service/extract-entities/`
  - Standalone entity extraction from text
  - Useful for quick entity identification

- **Data Validation**: `POST /ai_service/validate-lead/`
  - Validate lead data structure and content
  - Quality scoring and error reporting

- **Enhanced History**: `GET /ai_service/history/`
  - Improved conversation history with pagination
  - Summary information and confidence scores

### 5. Response Formatting
- **Structured API Responses**:
  ```json
  {
      "success": true,
      "analysis_id": "uuid",
      "lead_information": { /* extracted data */ },
      "validation": {
          "is_valid": true,
          "errors": [],
          "warnings": [],
          "data_quality_score": 85.0
      },
      "entities": { /* extracted entities */ },
      "recommendations": { /* AI recommendations */ },
      "processing_metadata": {
          "processed_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
          "ai_model": "gemini-1.5-flash",
          "extraction_version": "2.0"
      }
  }
  ```

### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Test Coverage**: `ai_service/tests.py`
  - DataValidator unit tests (email, phone, data validation)
  - GeminiAIService tests (extraction, confidence scoring, completeness)
  - API endpoint tests (all new endpoints)
  - Lead extraction accuracy tests with sample conversations
  - Model integration tests
