## üß™ Test Data

### Sample Conversation for Testing
```
Sales Rep (Sarah): Good afternoon, Mr. Rodriguez. Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I understand from our initial conversation that DataFlow Solutions is experiencing some challenges with your current customer management processes?

Prospect (Miguel Rodriguez - VP of Operations): That's right, Sarah. We're a mid-market logistics company with about 350 employees across five locations. Honestly, we're drowning in spreadsheets and our team is using three different systems that don't talk to each other. But before we go further, I need to be upfront‚Äîwe just implemented a new ERP system six months ago, and there's some... let's call it "change fatigue" in the organization.

Miguel: Well, our customer retention has dropped 12% over the past year. Our account managers are spending 60% of their time on administrative tasks instead of actually managing relationships. And here's the kicker‚Äîlast month we lost a $2.3 million contract because three different team members contacted the same client with conflicting information. The client felt we were disorganized and unprofessional.
```

### Expected AI Analysis Results
- **Company**: DataFlow Solutions
- **Contact**: Miguel Rodriguez (VP of Operations)
- **Industry**: Logistics
- **Company Size**: 350 employees across 5 locations
- **Pain Points**: Customer retention drop, admin burden, lost contract
- **Requirements**: Unified customer data, ERP integration
- **Quality Score**: 80+ (high confidence)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server Not Starting**
```bash
# Check if port 8000 is in use
netstat -an | findstr :8000

# Try different port
python manage.py runserver 8001
```

**API Endpoints Failing**
- Verify Gemini API key in `.env` file
- Check database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
- Ensure authentication is disabled for testing

**Frontend Not Loading**
- Check static files configuration in `settings.py`
- Verify template directory is configured
- Clear browser cache

**AI Analysis Returns Empty Results**
- Verify Gemini API key is valid
- Check internet connection
- Review API quota limits

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to Django settings:
```python
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'ai_service': {
            'handlers': ['console'],
            'level': 'DEBUG',
        },
    },
}
```
