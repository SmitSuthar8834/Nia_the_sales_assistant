# Maintenance Practices and Procedures

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the maintenance practices and procedures to keep the NIA Sales Assistant codebase clean, organized, and maintainable following the comprehensive cleanup effort.

## 🏗 Project Structure Maintenance

### Directory Organization Rules

#### Root Directory
- **Keep minimal**: Only essential configuration files
- **Maximum 10 files** in root directory
- **No temporary files** or debug scripts in root

#### Documentation (`docs/`)
- **Organize by category**: api/, implementation/, setup/, ui_testing/
- **Update regularly**: Keep documentation current with code changes
- **Review quarterly**: Ensure all documentation is accurate and useful

#### Tests (`tests/`)
- **Group by service**: ai_service/, meeting_service/, voice_service/, users/
- **Consistent naming**: test_*.py for all test files
- **Update imports**: Ensure test imports work with new structure

#### Scripts (`scripts/`)
- **Categorize by purpose**: testing/, debugging/, deployment/
- **No root scripts**: All utility scripts go in appropriate subdirectory
- **Document usage**: Add README.md in each script directory

## 🧪 Testing Maintenance

### Test Organization Standards
```bash
tests/
├── ai_service/           # AI service specific tests
├── meeting_service/      # Meeting service tests
├── voice_service/        # Voice service tests
├── users/               # User management tests
├── utils/               # Shared test utilities
└── conftest.py          # Pytest configuration
```

### Test Maintenance Schedule
- **Weekly**: Run full test suite and fix any failures
- **Monthly**: Review test coverage and add missing tests
- **Quarterly**: Refactor and optimize test performance
- **Before releases**: Complete test validation

### Test Quality Standards
- **Descriptive names**: Clear test method names
- **Proper organization**: Tests in correct service directory

- ❌ Don't forget to update UI testing specs
- ❌ Don't skip documenting API changes

## 🛠 Tools and Automation

### Code Quality Tools
```bash
# Install development tools
pip install black flake8 isort coverage

# Format code
black .

# Check style
flake8 .

# Sort imports
isort .

# Check coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 22.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 4.0.1
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
    rev: 5.10.1
    hooks:
      - id: isort
```

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD
# Run tests on every pull request
# Check code quality automatically
# Update documentation automatically
```
