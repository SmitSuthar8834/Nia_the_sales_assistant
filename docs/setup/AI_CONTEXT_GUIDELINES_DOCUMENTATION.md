## Implementation

### Context-Aware Prompt Generation

The system automatically builds context-aware prompts for all AI interactions:

```python
def build_context_prompt(prompt_type: str, additional_context: dict = None) -> str:
    """Build a context-aware prompt for AI interactions"""
    base_prompt = PROMPT_TEMPLATES.get(prompt_type, "")
    
    # Add company context
    company_context = f"""
    COMPANY CONTEXT:
    You are providing recommendations for {company_profile['name']}, 
    an {company_profile['industry']} company...
    """
    
    # Add methodology context
    methodology_context = f"""
    SALES METHODOLOGY:
    Use {sales_methodology['primary_approach']} approach...
    """
    
    return base_prompt + company_context + methodology_context
```

### Industry Context Integration

Industry-specific context is automatically applied based on lead data:

```python
def get_context_for_industry(industry: str) -> dict:
    """Get industry-specific context and guidelines"""
    industry_context = INDUSTRY_INSIGHTS.get(industry, default_context)
    return {
        'common_pain_points': industry_context['pain_points'],
        'decision_makers': industry_context['stakeholders'],
        'sales_approach': industry_context['approach'],
        'key_messaging': industry_context['messaging']
    }
```

### Enhanced AI Service Methods

All AI service methods now use context guidelines:

1. **Lead Quality Scoring**: Incorporates industry-specific scoring criteria
2. **Sales Strategy Generation**: Uses industry best practices and company strengths
3. **Industry Insights**: Leverages comprehensive industry knowledge base
4. **Recommendations**: Applies sales methodology and priority frameworks

## Configuration and Customization

    # ... other settings
}

# Customize AI behavior
AI_BEHAVIOR_CONFIG = {
    "tone": "professional_consultative",
    "confidence_threshold": 70,
    "personalization_level": "high"
}
```

### Industry Customization

Add or modify industry-specific settings:

```python
INDUSTRY_CUSTOMIZATION = {
    "your_industry": {

    "lead_quality_weights": {
        "data_completeness": 0.20,
        "budget_fit": 0.25,
        "timeline_urgency": 0.20,
        # ... other weights
    },
    "confidence_thresholds": {
