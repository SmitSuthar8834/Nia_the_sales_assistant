- `_generate_additional_preparation_materials(meeting)` - Additional preparation materials
- `_format_existing_agenda(meeting)` - Format existing agenda for return
- `_get_default_*()` methods - Fallback content when AI generation fails

#### Error Handling & Resilience
- Comprehensive exception handling for all AI operations
- Fallback to default materials when AI generation fails
- Logging for debugging and monitoring
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable

#### Data Structure Examples

##### Meeting Agenda Response
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "agenda_generated": true,
    "formatted_agenda": "Complete formatted agenda text with timing",
    "agenda_structure": {
        "opening": {"duration_minutes": 5, "objectives": [...], "key_points": [...]},
        "discovery": {"duration_minutes": 20, "objectives": [...], "key_points": [...]},
        "presentation": {"duration_minutes": 25, "objectives": [...], "key_points": [...]},
        "next_steps": {"duration_minutes": 10, "objectives": [...], "key_points": [...]}
    },
    "key_objectives": ["primary meeting goals"],
    "time_allocation": {"total_minutes": 60, "opening_percentage": 8, ...},
    "success_metrics": ["measurable outcomes to track"],
    "generation_metadata": {"agenda_type": "discovery", "complexity_level": "medium", ...}
}
```

##### Comprehensive Preparation Package
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "meeting_id": "uuid",
    "lead_company": "Company Name",
    "meeting_type": "discovery",
    "agenda": {...},
    "talking_points": {...},
    "competitive_analysis": {...},
    "preparation_checklist": [...],
    "key_research_points": [...],
    "potential_objections": [...],
    "success_criteria": [...],
    "follow_up_actions": [...],
    "risk_mitigation": [...],
    "preparation_summary": {
        "meeting_readiness_score": 85,
        "key_focus_areas": [...],
        "critical_success_factors": [...],
        "recommended_approach": "...",
        "time_to_prepare_minutes": 30
    }
