# Voice Service Implementation Summary

## Task 6: Build Voice Call Handling Infrastructure

### ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

This task has been successfully implemented with all required components for voice call handling infrastructure.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The voice service follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

### Core Models
- **CallSession**: Tracks voice call sessions with status, timing, and metadata
- **AudioChunk**: Stores audio data chunks for processing and transcription
- **ConversationTurn**: Records conversation turns between user and NIA
- **VoiceConfiguration**: User-specific voice processing settings

### Services
- **VoiceProcessingService**: Main service for handling voice operations
- **AudioBufferManager**: Manages real-time audio buffering
- **Google Cloud Integration**: Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/voice/initiate/` - Start a new voice call session
- `POST /api/voice/webrtc/setup/` - Setup WebRTC connection
- `POST /api/voice/process-audio/` - Process audio for transcription
- `POST /api/voice/generate-speech/` - Generate speech responses
- `POST /api/voice/end/` - End voice call session
- `GET /api/voice/session/{id}/status/` - Get session status
- `GET /api/voice/sessions/` - Get user's call sessions
- `GET/PUT /api/voice/config/` - Voice configuration management

### WebSocket Support
- Real-time voice processing via WebSocket connections
- Bidirectional audio streaming
- Live transcription updates
- Session management commands

POST /api/voice/initiate/
{
    "caller_id": "555-0123"
}

# Response
{
    "session_id": "uuid-here",
    "status": "active",
    "start_time": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "message": "Call session initiated successfully"
}
```

### WebSocket Connection
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:8000/ws/voice/${sessionId}/`);
ws.onmessage = function(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    console.log('Transcription:', data.transcription);
};
```
