### üèóÔ∏è Implementation Overview

#### 1. Core Service: `MeetingOutcomeService`

**File:** `meeting_service/meeting_outcome_service.py`

A comprehensive service class that handles all meeting outcome tracking functionality:

```python
class MeetingOutcomeService:
    """Service for tracking and analyzing meeting outcomes"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.ai_service = GeminiAIService()
    
    # Main methods:
    def generate_meeting_summary(meeting, regenerate=False)
    def extract_action_items(meeting, regenerate=False)  
    def schedule_follow_up_actions(meeting)
    def update_lead_scoring(meeting)
    def process_complete_meeting_outcome(meeting, regenerate=False)
```

#### 2. Key Features Implemented

  "description": "Clear description of the action",
  "assigned_to": "Person responsible",
  "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "category": "follow_up|research|proposal|demo|documentation|internal",
